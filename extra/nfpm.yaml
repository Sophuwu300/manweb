description: """manhttpd is a frontend for the linux man pages.
Offering a functional, minimalistic interface for viewing and finding pages.
The service offers multiple search options:
- Search directly by page name
- Search by keyword/wildcard
- Search by section number
- Full regex name and description search
It is very fast for the features it offers. 

It is useful for serving manpages over a network, or for browsing them
in a web browser.

manhttpd is written in C and is very lightweight. It can be run as a
systemd service or as a standalone binary.
